Description:

This project is a custom zip format i have made up. It consists of two files, the actually compressed file (.Dzip, yes I know that already exists, im going to com up with a better name later), and a dictionary file for unzipping it (.DzDctnry). 

Both files are important if you want to decompress the file, the dictionary is like the key to the file if you lose it you cant decompress it.

Currently it is a bit limited, it can only compress a .txt file and all the words should be on a single line, if they are not it will not work as well. The last limitation is it can only compress the document if there are under 24 unique repeated words within the text file.

Use:

It is a terminal interface, (you can ignor the random lists it spits out, those were for debugging), but every now and then it will give you a prompt you have to answer.
the files that you are encoding/decoding need to be in the same direcoty as the program otherwise you will very likly run into errors.

If you have suggestions feel free to reach on the github page, i ccan't promise i'll get to them but i might.

I don't really expect other people to use this, it was mostly a fun project for me to work on but if you like it feel free to comment.

If you make a project based off of this and post it I would like credit however feel free to use it in anything you want.
